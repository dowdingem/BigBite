BITE BITE : 'Interpreting Biotic Interactions in the Fossil Record: Evidence and Evolutionary Significance'

This repo hosts the supplementary material, including glossary, addtional notes on process, and the FAD occurrence (both direct and indirect) of fossilised biotic interactions. Public active links will be provided after submission and/or acceptance.

The First Appearance data for Figure 1: https://github.com/dowdingem/BigBite/blob/main/Fig_1_data%20(1).xlsx
  Sheets 2 and 3 hold information about supplementary 2 (https://github.com/dowdingem/BigBite/blob/main/Supplement/Dataframework.pdf) and 3 (https://github.com/dowdingem/BigBite/blob/main/Supplement/Scale%20Gap.pdf).

Within the Supplement folder are the text, images, and citations for Supplement 1-3 of Dowding et al (in prep).

This work was done within the context of the Biotic Interactions in deep TimE (BITE) working group in preparation for estbalishing a dedicated database for hosting and curating fossil biotic interaction data.
